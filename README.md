# openscad_objects
Functions for creating and accessing object-like lists in OpenSCAD

# Installing
Until we get packaging up and running here, the simpliest way to install this is to download the most recent zip from Github, and copy the `object_common_functions.scad` file into your OpenSCAD library directory. 

You'll need the most-excellent BOSL2 framework to get this working; see https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL2 for instructions on how to download and incorporate it. 

# A Quick Note
A lot of this project might be generously considered "works for me", and I'm entirely not sure what'll happen when you use it for *you*. That's ok! If something doesn't seem to work right, I think a GitHub issue is perhaps the best way to let me know. I'll try to respond as quickly as life permits.
